A Note on Batch Scripting

A "README.docx" should also be included with this script
And covers many of the same details in here
With pictures and additional documentation
If you are a non-technical user, read that documentation instead

Microsoft Windows Batch is really old and poorly specified.
   "Wikipedia: Batch file"
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file
But it is included by default on all Windows OS < Windows 11
(Please use PowerShell or Python for Windows 11 and greater)

Because of the finnicky and confusing nature of Batch
I have commented each line of code with an explanation of what we are doing
And included a linked article to explain what is going on.
Most of these linked articles are on StackOverflow or one of its various subsidiaries
   "Wikipedia: Stack Overflow"
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow
These include a discussion and a list of alternate solutions

Because Windows cannot distinguish betweewn uppercase and lowercase letters
Snake case is used in all the variable names
   "Wikipedia: Snake case"
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case

To edit Batch Scripts, please use a decent Text Editor
(NOT "notepad.exe" (default on Windows Installs))
If possible download Microsoft Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/
(Free and Lightweight)

Right click a ".bat" file and choose "Edit" from the options
You can also "Create a Shortcut", this is recommended for the "prompt.bat" file
